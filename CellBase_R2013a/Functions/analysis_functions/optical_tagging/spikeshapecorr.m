function R = spikeshapecorr(cellid)
%SPIKESHAPECORR   Correlation of spontaneous and light-evoked spike shape.
%   R = SPIKESHAPECORR(CELLID) calculates correlation coefficient between
%   the waveform of spontaneous and putative light-evoked spikes. It finds
%   the latency of putative light-evoked spikes as peaks of firing rate
%   after light pulses. The period for putative light-evoked spikes is
%   defined by half-hight crossings around the peak (see FINDSTIMPERIOD for
%   details). If there is no detectable activation, 1 and 6 ms are used,
%   which include typical latencies of light-evoked spikes. Spontaneous
%   spikes are extracted from 2 s periods before light bursts. Waveforms
%   are restricted to 750 us (default of DigiLynx censored period). NaN is
%   returned if there are less than 2 evoked and/or spontaneous spikes.
%   Correlation is calculated for the channel with the largest spikes.
